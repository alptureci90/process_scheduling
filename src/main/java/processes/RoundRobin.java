 Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/
 Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.

 It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU.
 One of the most commonly used technique in CPU scheduling as a core.
 It is preemptive as processes are assigned CPU only for a fixed slice of time at most.
 The disadvantage of it is more overhead of context switching.
